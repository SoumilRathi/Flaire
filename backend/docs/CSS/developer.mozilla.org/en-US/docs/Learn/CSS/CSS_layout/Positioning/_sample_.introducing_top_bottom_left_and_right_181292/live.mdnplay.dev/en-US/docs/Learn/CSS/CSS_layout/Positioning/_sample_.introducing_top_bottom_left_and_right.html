<p>
  I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new
  lines below me.
</p>

<p class="positioned">
  By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall
  as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding +
  border width/height.
</p>

<p>
  We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
  separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
</p>

<p>
  Inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on
  the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is space on
  the same line. Overflowing inline elements
  <span>wrap onto a new line if possible â€” like this one containing text</span>,
  or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do:
  <img alt="snippet of cloth" src="./long.jpg"></img>
</p>
