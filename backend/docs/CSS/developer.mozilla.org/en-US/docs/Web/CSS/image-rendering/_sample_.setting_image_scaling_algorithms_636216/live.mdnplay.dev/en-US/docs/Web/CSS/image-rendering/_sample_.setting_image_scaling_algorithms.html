  <img src="./blumen.jpg" alt="A small photo of some white and yellow flower against a leafy green background. The image is about 33% smaller than the size it is being displayed at. This upscaling causes the image to appear blurry, with notable soft edges between objects." class="auto"></img>
  <img src="./blumen.jpg" alt="The same photo as the previous image, which is also being upscaled the same amount. Browsers that support the pixelated value for the image-rendering property display the image as very pixelated. Individual pixels are clearly visible and edges appear much sharper." class="pixelated"></img>
  <img src="./blumen.jpg" alt="The same photo as the previous images, which is also being upscaled the same amount. Browsers that support the crisp-edges value for the image-rendering property display the image as very pixelated. In these examples, there is virtually no perceivable difference between the pixelated and crisp-edges versions." class="crisp-edges"></img>
