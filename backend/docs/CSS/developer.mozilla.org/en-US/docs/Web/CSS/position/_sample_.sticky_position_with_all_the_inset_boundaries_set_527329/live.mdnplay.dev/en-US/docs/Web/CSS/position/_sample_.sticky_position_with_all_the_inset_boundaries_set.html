    The representation of an idea by a light bulb(<span class="bulb">ðŸ’¡</span>)
    is a commonly used metaphor that symbolizes the moment of inspiration or the
    birth of a new idea. The association between a light bulb and an idea can be
    traced back to the invention of the incandescent light bulb(<span class="bulb">ðŸ’¡</span>) by Thomas Edison in the late 19th century. The light bulb is a powerful
    symbol because it represents illumination, clarity, and the sudden
    brightening of one's thoughts or understanding. When someone has an idea, it
    is often described as a light bulb turning on in their mind, signifying a
    moment of insight or creativity. The image of a light bulb also suggests the
    idea of energy, power, and the potential for growth and development.
