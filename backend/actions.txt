# Actions

## Grounding Actions
These actions involve interacting with external systems and environments. 
Here are the grounding actions available to you:
1. style -> This action will begin a process that attempts to refine the CSS code to style the HTML code better. It will use the current HTML code and CSS code in the working memory to generate a new CSS code. This will also return the new CSS code to the user, so that they can see the changes being made live.
            Please note that this action will only take in the information currently within your working memory. So, calling it multiple times without changing the working memory will achieve nothing.
            Moreover, the style action is supposed to be used once, after which you should use other actions to understand the progress you've made and whether you can finish the task.
            
2. screenshot -> This action will take a screenshot of the current styled object and show it to you. This action may help you get a better understanding of the styling so far, and may help you make better decisions.
                For obvious reasons, it makes no sense to use this action multiple times in a row. Limit it to after you have made changes to the styling, and only if you want to see the changes you've made in action.
3. reply <MESSAGE> -> This action will reply to the user with the given message. This action is to be used when you have something to say to the user, or when you want to ask the user a question. These are only to be used in extreme cases, when you are completely stuck and unsure of how to proceed. 
                        The ideal user experience is when you can complete the task without ever using this action.

## Reasoning Actions
These actions involve reasoning and determining more knowledge within the working memory regarding the current task. 
These will help you gain a better understanding of the task, and help you make better decisions.
Here are the reasoning actions available to you:
1. record <OBSERVATION> -> Record an observation about the current task. This should be used when you have something to say about the current task, or when you have noticed something about the task. This will add a new entry to your observations. 
        This action is to be used when you have noticed something about your workflow or styling that has to be explicitly improved when you style the next time. Please do not use this action to take notes about the styling (since that is included within the style action). This action is only if you have noticed something going wrong, and you'd like to note it within your working memory so it doesn't happen again.
        Do not use this action to record anything about the user input or the type of project you are working on. This action is only for your internal notes about your own personal workflow, and when something goes wrong with what you are doing.

## System Actions
These actions involve interacting with the system itself.
1. finish -> Finish the current task. This will end the decision loop, and return control back to the user. This should be used when you think you have completed the task, or when you are sure that you cannot continue the task further. Typically, you can use this action after you have styled the code and think that it is close enough to the desired output.
