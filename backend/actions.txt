# Actions

## Grounding Actions
These actions involve interacting with external systems and environments. 
Here are the grounding actions available to you:
1. style -> This action will begin a process that attempts to refine the CSS code to style the HTML code better. It will use the current HTML code and CSS code in the working memory to generate a new CSS code. This will also return the new CSS code to the user, so that they can see the changes being made live.
2. screenshot -> This action will take a screenshot of the current styled object and show it to you. This action may help you get a better understanding of the styling so far, and may help you make better decisions.

## Reasoning Actions
These actions involve reasoning and determining more knowledge within the working memory regarding the current task. 
These will help you gain a better understanding of the task, and help you make better decisions.
Here are the reasoning actions available to you:
1. record <OBSERVATION> -> Record an observation about the current task. This should be used when you have something to say about the current task, or when you have noticed something about the task. This will add a new entry to your observations. This action is to be used when you have noticed something about your workflow or styling that has to be explicitly improved when you style the next time. 

## System Actions
These actions involve interacting with the system itself.
1. finish -> Finish the current task. This will end the decision loop, and return control back to the user. This should be used when you think you have completed the task, or when you are sure that you cannot continue the task further.
