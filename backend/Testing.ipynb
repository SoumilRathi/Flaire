    "You are an intelligent agent specializing in frontend web development. Your task is to analyze HTML code and separate it into distinct UI components. This process is crucial for organizing and styling web pages effectively.\n",

    "<html_code>\n",
    "{code}\n",
    "</html_code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Carefully examine the provided HTML code.\n",
    "2. Identify and separate every single UI component within the code. This includes, but is not limited to:\n",
    "   - Buttons\n",
    "   - Input fields\n",
    "   - Dropdowns\n",
    "   - Select options\n",
    "   - Forms\n",

    "   - Footers\n",
    "   - Modals or popups\n",
    "   - Cards or content blocks\n",
    "   - Any other distinct UI elements\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each identified component:\n",
    "   a. Create a generalized name that could be reused across different pages of a website.\n",
    "   b. Ensure the name includes any elements that would affect the component's design.\n",
    "   c. Consider how the component will appear on the final rendered webpage when determining its name.\n",
    "   d. Essentially, name the component based on how it will look on the final page, not based on it's functionality.\n",
    "    This is because buttons will likely look the same across webpages even if one of them is a message button and another is an email button etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Separate the HTML code for each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Present your findings in the following format for each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "Component Name\n",
    "HTML Code for component\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "PrimaryButton\n",
    "<button class=\"btn btn-primary\">Click me</button>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before providing your final output, wrap your component identification process in <component_identification> tags. In this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Break down the overall structure of the HTML code.\n",
    "2. List each potential component you identify, numbering them sequentially.\n",
    "3. For each potential component:\n",
    "   a. Quote the relevant HTML code.\n",
    "   b. Explain why you consider it a separate component.\n",
    "   c. Justify your chosen name for the component.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will ensure a thorough interpretation of the code structure and component identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "After your component identification process, list all the identified components with their respective HTML code in the format specified above.\n",

      "- The button uses a div instead of a native <button> element\n",
